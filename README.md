# SelfHeal

Addon dynamically modifies `SelfHeal` macro before player enters combat. Depending on what player has in the bags and if that item is on cooldown or not, macro will prioritize usage of Healthstone or Healing Potion.

# Usage
- Install the addon
- Create an empty macro called: `SelfHeal`
    - Next time you enter combat, macro will be populated
- Use macro to heal yourself
